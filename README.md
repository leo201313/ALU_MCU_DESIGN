# Start to design the MCU
In the early days, we've complete the ALU design only used the gates. Finally, we got to the main projetc which is to design the MCU.
### The main components included in this MCU:
* PC Counters ---- Not Done
* Instruction MeM ---- Not Done
* Register Field ---- Not Done
* ALU ---- Not Done
* Data MeM ---- Not Done
### Anything needs to draw attention will be dispalyed here
* We've decided to choose the second test project which is a matrix mutiply.
* Using single cycle microarchitecture is definitely not fit for this course design. 
* Three parts will use the IP core: Data MeM, Instruction MeM, and clock.
